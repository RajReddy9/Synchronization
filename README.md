# Synchronization
## Introduction
In this assignment you will complete an implementation of a message queue by adding the necessary locks and condition variable operations to synchronize access to the message queue. You will also implement I/O multiplexing functionality - monitoring multiple queues for events (e.g. new messages) in a single thread - modeled after the `poll()` system call.
